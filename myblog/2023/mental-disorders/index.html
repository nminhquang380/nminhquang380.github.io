It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. There are many different types of mental disorders. Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions.</p> <p>In 2019, <strong>1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder</strong>, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common. In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial estimates show a <strong>26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders</strong> in just <strong>one year</strong>. While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience <strong>stigma</strong>, <strong>discrimination</strong> and <strong>violations</strong> of human rights.</p> <h2 id="anxiety-disorders">Anxiety Disorders</h2> <p>In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents.</p> <p>Anxiety disorders are characterised by <strong>excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances</strong>. There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>generalised anxiety disorder</strong> (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks),</li> <li> <strong>social anxiety disorder</strong> (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations),</li> <li> <strong>separation anxiety disorder</strong> (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond),</li> <li>and others.</li> </ul> <h2 id="depression">Depression</h2> <p>In 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23 million children and adolescents.</p> <p>Depression is <strong>different</strong> from usual <strong>mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses</strong> to challenges in everyday life. During a depressive episode, the person experiences <strong>depressed mood</strong> (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a <strong>loss of pleasure or interest in activities</strong>, for most of the day, nearly every day, for <strong>at least two weeks</strong>.</p> <p>Several other symptoms are also present, which may include <strong>poor concentration</strong>, feelings of <strong>excessive guilt or low self-worth</strong>, <strong>hopelessness</strong> about the future, <strong>thoughts about dying or suicide</strong>, <strong>disrupted sleep</strong>, <strong>changes in appetite or weight</strong>, and feeling especially tired or low in energy. People with depression are <strong>at an increased risk of suicide</strong>.</p> <h2 id="bipolar-disorder">Bipolar Disorder</h2> <p>In 2019, 40 million people experienced bipolar disorder.</p> <p>People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic(<em>very excited or anxious (= worried and nervous) in a way that causes you to be very physically active</em>) symptoms. During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day. Manic symptoms may include <strong>euphoria or irritability</strong>, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and <strong>impulsive reckless behaviour</strong>.</p> <p>People with bipolar disorder are at an increased <strong>risk of suicide</strong>.</p> <h2 id="post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2> <p>The prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in conflict-affected settings.</p> <p>PTSD may develop following <strong>exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event</strong> or <strong>series</strong> of events. It is characterised by all of the following:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>re-experiencing the traumatic event</strong> or events in the present (intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares).</li> <li> <strong>avoidance</strong> of <strong>thoughts and memories of the event</strong>(s), or avoidance of <strong>activities</strong>, <strong>situations</strong>, or people <strong>reminiscent of the event</strong>(s).</li> <li> <strong>persistent perceptions</strong> of heightened current <strong>threat</strong>.</li> </ol> <p>These symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning.</p> <h2 id="schizophrenia">Schizophrenia</h2> <p>Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people worldwide.</p> <p>People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10-20 years below that of the general population.</p> <p>Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in perception and changes in behaviour. Symptoms may include persistent delusions, hallucinations(<em>an experience in which you see, hear, feel, or smell something that does not exist</em>), disorganised thinking, highly disorganised behaviour, or extreme agitation(<em>worry and anxiety</em>).</p> <p>People with schizophrenia may experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive functioning.</p> <h2 id="eating-disorders">Eating Disorders</h2> <p>In 2019, 14 million people experienced eating disorders including almost 3 million children and adolescents.</p> <p>Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns.</p> <p>The symptoms or behaviours result in significant risk or damage to health, significant distress, or significant impairment of functioning. Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with premature death due to medical complications or suicide. Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk for substance use, suicidality, and health complications.</p> <h2 id="disruptive-behaviour-and-dissocial-disorders">Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders</h2> <p>40 million people, including children and adolescents, were living with conduct-dissocial disorder in 2019. This disorder, also known as <strong>conduct disorder</strong> , is one of two disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, the other is <strong>oppositional defiant disorder</strong>.</p> <p>Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are characterised by <strong>persistent behaviour problems such as persistently defiant or disobedient</strong> to behaviours that persistently <strong>violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws.</strong></p> <p>Onset of disruptive and dissocial disorders, is commonly, though not always, during childhood.</p> <h2 id="neurodevelopmental-disorders">Neurodevelopmental Disorders</h2> <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders are <strong>behavioural and cognitive disorders</strong>, that arise during the <strong>developmental period</strong>, and involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of <strong>specific intellectual, motor, language, or social functions</strong>.</p> <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders include disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) amongst others.</p> <p><strong>ADHD</strong> is characterised by a <strong>persistent pattern of inattention</strong> and/or <strong>hyperactivity-impulsivity</strong> that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning.</p> <p><strong>Disorders of intellectual development</strong> are characterised by s<strong>ignificant limitations in intellectual functioning</strong> and adaptive behaviour, which refers to difficulties with everyday conceptual, social, and practical skills that are performed in daily life.</p> <p><strong>Autism spectrum disorder</strong> (ASD) constitutes a diverse group of conditions characterised by some degree of <strong>difficulty with social communication</strong> and reciprocal social interaction, as well as persistent <strong>restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities</strong>.</p> <h2 id="who-is-at-risk-from-developing-a-mental-disoder">Who is at risk from developing a mental disoder?</h2> <p>At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community, and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability, and inequality – are at higher risk. Protective and risk factors include individual psychological and biological factors, such as emotional skills as well as genetics. Many of the risk and protective factors are influenced through changes in brain structure and/or function.</p> <h2 id="reference">Reference</h2> <p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mental Disorders - World Health Organization</a></p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/myblog/2023/build-ds-project/">Get lost when trying to build a Data Science Project</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/myblog/2023/dopamine-detox/">Dopamine Detox</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/myblog/2023/error_exception_python/">Error and Exception in Python</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/myblog/2023/lack-of-motivation/">You aren't Lazy: Exploring a Lack of Motivation</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/myblog/2023/machine-learning-deep-learning/">Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Duc Minh Quang Nguyen. # Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">al-folio</a> theme. # Hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">GitHub Pages</a>. # Photos from <a href="https://unsplash.com" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Unsplash</a>. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?7b30caa5023af4af8408a472dc4e1ebb"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.22.1/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?d633890033921b33e0ceb13d22340a9c"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?acdb9690d7641b2f8d40529018c71a01"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?07b8786bab9b4abe90d10e61f7d12ff7" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
