Deep learning is a specific kind of machine learning. To understand deep learning
well, one must have a solid understanding of the basic principles of machine learning.

## 1. Learning Algorithms
â€œA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T , as
measured by P, improves with experience E."

E:
- Unsupervised Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Semi-supervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

P:
- Depend on several factors
  
T:
- Classification
- Regression
- Anatomy Prediction
