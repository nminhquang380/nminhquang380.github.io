Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in our brains that motivates us to do activities that make us feel pleasure. When you engage in a pleasurable activity, dopamine releases in your brain.

Too much dopamine, however, can lead to addiction, including drug addiction and video game addiction.

The more video games you play, the more you can need to play them to satisfy your needs, leading to disordered play or addiction. 

In recent years, a new solution suggested by mental health specialists is a dopamine detox. Dopamine detox, or dopamine fasting, is a term first coined by Dr. Cameron Sepah, a Harvard psychiatrist from California.

In this article, you’ll learn how to do a dopamine detox, what dopamine detox is, and what positive effects it can have on your life.

## What is the Dopamine Theory of Addiction?

The dopamine theory of addiction suggests an imbalance in dopamine production in the brain causes addictions.

**Instead of getting enough dopamine from everyday activities, individuals suffering from addiction rely on receiving dopamine from drugs, alcohol, video games, or other external stimuli instead.**

The addicted individual requires more of their stimuli of choice (drugs, alcohol, video games) to feel satisfied. 

According to Mellis et al. (2005), the dopamine theory of addiction goes like this:

*“Decreased DA (dopamine) function in addicted subjects results in a decreased interest to non-drug-related stimuli and increased sensitivity to the drug of choice.”*

The dopamine theory of addiction suggests that dopamine is at the center of the addiction. With research suggesting that dopamine is the driver behind addictive actions, professionals have started treating addictions by addressing dopamine.

## What Triggers Dopamine?

**Dopamine is triggered by any pleasurable or rewarding activity we do. This includes everyday activities like eating or drinking to more addictive activities like taking drugs, alcohol, sex, or playing video games.**

The key difference here is that some activities release more dopamine than others.

Taking drugs and playing video games produce an instant rush of cheap dopamine. According to some studies, video games release large amounts of dopamine in our brains – comparable to when taking drugs like amphetamine. And because these activities release more dopamine than others, we feel more pleasure doing them. So, consequently, we do more of these activities.

Our brain gets used to the stimulus after some time, which means that we’ll need to take more and more of the drug or play more video games to satisfy our needs. Other activities start to feel less enjoyable compared to our desired stimulus.

In addition, playing video games is convenient and sedentary, and it doesn’t take much effort to experience pleasure. You only need to open your phone or computer and start playing the game, and you’ll almost instantly begin experiencing stimulation and pleasure.

If we compare gaming to less convenient or higher effort activities that produce dopamine like going to the gym, playing video games starts to feel more comfortable. We can justify neglecting other activities for the instant gratification of gaming.

## What are the Side Effects of Too Much Dopamine?

Dopamine is one of the most important chemicals in our brain. Its presence is required for normal functioning and often affects our mood and how we feel.

Having optimal amounts of dopamine is crucial for the normal functioning of our body, and it also helps us feel satisfied. Optimal levels of dopamine can contribute to being more alert, satisfied, productive, and motivated. 

Having too much or too little dopamine can drastically change the way we live and feel.

The side effects of too much dopamine include:

- ADHD
- Addictions
- Binge-eating and other binging behaviors
- Gambling 
- Obesity

High levels of dopamine can also be a contributing factor to many states of mind, including:

- Mania
- Hallucinations
- Delusion
- Schizophrenia

Often, these conditions can present when someone takes a drug that increases dopamine levels. If the stimulus produces too much dopamine, then you may end up feeling like you’re on top of the world to the point where your brain can go into overdrive, leading to mental health issues and the potential conditions above.

Low levels of dopamine can also be problematic. Some of the potential side effects of low levels of dopamine include:

- Reduced alertness
- No motivation
- Coordination difficulties
- Possibility of depression, Parkinson’s disease, anxiety

When doing a dopamine detox, you must keep a good balance in your dopamine levels. Since you’ll stop doing activities that produce high amounts of dopamine, you’ll need to replace them with activities that will also produce enough dopamine to satisfy you, such as exercise.

## What is a Dopamine Detox?

A dopamine detox is abstaining from all addictive activities that raise your levels of dopamine too high. 

The idea behind the detox is to stop being dependent on activities like social media, video games, gambling, and other addictive behaviors. You’ll abstain from instant hits of dopamine and replace them with healthier activities that produce dopamine.

With the detox, you’ll stop doing these addictive activities for a set period, which is often recommended to be around 90 days. 

Dr. Cameron Sepah created the original concept of dopamine detox. His idea was to help tech workers and venture capitalists stop dependence on social media and phone notifications.

The detox aims to prevent addictions to external stimuli and become less dependent on the dopamine produced by social media, video games, gambling, and other similar activities.

According to Dr. Sepah, there are six key areas that the dopamine detox targets:

1. Emotional eating
2. Excessive internet usage and gaming
3. Gambling and shopping
4. Porn and masturbation
5. Thrill and novelty seeking
6. Recreational drugs

Now, it’s impossible to do a true dopamine detox. Your body will not instantly stop producing dopamine as you enter detox, as it will still get produced by other activities you do. But the goal of dopamine detox is not to eliminate all pleasurable activities but to stop the ones that get you addicted and cause problems in your life.

The key here is that you get dopamine from activities that truly make you feel happy and satisfied and the ones that make you healthy.

So that’s what a dopamine detox is, but can it be effective?

## Do Dopamine Detoxes Work?

The brain starts to change:

- Your reward system becomes numb to exposure to activities that might otherwise be pleasurable. To feel pleasure, you’ll need to play video games more and more, and no other activities will be able to match the dopamine rush provided by video games.
- The extended amygdala is also affected, which causes you to feel anxious or depressed when you don’t play games. 
- Additionally, your prefrontal cortex may not function properly when you’re addicted to video games. This impairs your ability to think and make the right decisions, which might worsen the gaming addiction.

When you start a dopamine detox, these changes in your brain will begin to reverse. However, they will take time – and a lot of effort. 

Inevitably when you start the detox, it is going to be tough. The first two weeks will be the hardest. You might feel some withdrawal symptoms like depression, lack of motivation, anxiety, or headaches.

However, that is when you need to double down on your detox. But, again, these signs are positive, and they show that the detox is working.

Eventually, you’ll start to feel and think more positively, you’ll have more energy, and your cravings will begin to diminish. After some time, you won’t feel the need to play games anymore, and your life can change completely as long as you stick to the plan.

## My Personal Strategy

Like the article above says, Dopamine Detox will be a difficult challenge for anyone. Therefore, to tackle it, I need a certain plan which is merely fit to myself.

Firstly, I need a list of action that is healthy enough to give me dopamine. For that:
- Writing
- Playing sport
- Reading
- Drawing
- Listening calm music
- Coding and push them to GitHub
- Learning about Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- Meditating
- Doing photography
- Going out

Secondly, I will journal all of my Dopamine Detox process in a post, which will be continuously written by me. Now, I tend to last it for a week, and I hope I can strengthen it longer.
