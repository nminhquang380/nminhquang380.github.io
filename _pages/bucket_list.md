Today is 12/26/2022. Soon, I will embark on a long journey that will greatly change myself. Inspired by the book "Youth Without Regret," I also want to have a list of things I want to do before turning 25, a milestone in life. This list will include hobbies, interests, and even work-related items. I won't prioritize them, so let's try our best. For items related to knowledge, summarize what you have learned about them: religion, philosophy, law, economics, etc. For travel-related activities, write a review with accompanying photos. Regarding books you read, provide reviews, and for habits, share your feelings. In general, demonstrate what you have done and be honest.
