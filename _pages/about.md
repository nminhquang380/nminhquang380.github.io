I am currently studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology at La Trobe University as an international student. I have a keen interest in Machine Learning and Data Science, as well as Web Development. Please feel free to reach my [Github](github.com/nminhquang380) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nminhquang380) accounts below to see more about my Data Science notebooks and other projects. In addition, I am passionate about writing and also have a blog on Facebook where I write some blog posts in Vietnamese.

In the meantime, I am working remotely as a freelance Backend Developer for Risikotek Ptd based on Singapore. I have experience as an intern Software Engineer at A.I.Soft Company in Vietnam, where I worked on two noteworthy projects related to AI, which I have shared on my Github.

I am proud to have received scholarships for academic excellence three times in four semesters, and I was selected to become a member of the VMO team for my institute in Vietnam, although unfortunately, the competition was canceled due to the pandemic.
