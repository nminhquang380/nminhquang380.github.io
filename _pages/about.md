I am an international student at La Trobe University, pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology. My areas of interest include AI, Machine Learning, Web Development, and Deep Learning research, particularly in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I am open to contributing to research and projects in these fields.

Currently, I am a Data Analyst Intern at Whittlesea Community Connection in Melbourne. Previously, I worked remotely as a freelance Backend Developer for Risikotek Ptd in Singapore until January 2024. I also have experience as an intern Software Engineer at A.I.Soft Company in Vietnam, where I worked on two AI projects shared on my GitHub.

I received three scholarships in four semesters at the Post and Telecommunication Institute of Technology (PTIT) in Hanoi, Vietnam. I also received the Provost's Commendation for academic excellence at La Trobe University in Melbourne in 2023.

You can check out my Data Science notebooks and projects on my [Github](github.com/nminhquang380) account. Additionally, I enjoy writing blog posts in Vietnamese on Facebook.
